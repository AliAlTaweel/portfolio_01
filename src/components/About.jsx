      <p>
        Hi! I'm Ali Al-Taweel, a Front-End Web Developer . From choreography on
        a stage to lines of code on a web page, I love combining the worlds of
        logic and creative design to make eye-catching, accessible, and
        user-friendly websites and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span id="about_span_1">Technology leads, society follows.</span> The
        move towards increasing inclusivity and diversity in the industry
        through representation is of importance to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited to make the leap and continue refining my skills with the
        right company.
